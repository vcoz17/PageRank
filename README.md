# PageRank

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages.

PageRank (PR) of page C = PR(A)/2 + PR(B)/1. 
Moregenerally, PR(u) = Sum(PR(v)/Lv) over v in Bu â€“ where Bu is the set of pages that point to u, and Lv is the number of outgoing links from page v (not counting duplicate links)
