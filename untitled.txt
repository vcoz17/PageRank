My code structure is the same as what stated in the document. I have 2 additional files: avatar.c, and avatar.h to implement the Avatar.

How to start:
- gcc adventure.c items.c avatar.c room.c
- ./a.out
- Press s to start the game

For the game, I have a list of commands:

- room: Read room's description

- look: Get list of items in the room

- ivn: Look into the player's inventory

- H: get command list

- read ITEM: read the description of the specified ITEM (e.g.: map,...)

- go DIRECTION (e.g.: north, south, east, west, up, down): Go to room in the current room's direction

- take ITEM: Pick up the specified ITEM and put it into inventory

- use ITEM: Use the specified ITEM, which might change the room's state

- drop ITEM: Discard the specified ITEM off the inventory, and leave it in the current room
